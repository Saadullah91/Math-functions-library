# Math Operations Console Program
This C++ console application allows users to perform various mathematical operations through a menu-driven interface. The program includes functions such as power calculation, cube root, square root, logarithm, absolute value, and trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent.

Features
Power Function: Calculate the power of a number.
Cube Root: Find the cube root of a number.
Square Root: Calculate the square root of a number.
Logarithm: Compute the natural logarithm (log) of a number.
Absolute Value: Get the absolute value of a number.
Sin Function: Calculate the sine of a number.
Cos Function: Calculate the cosine of a number.
Tan Function: Calculate the tangent of a number.
Maximum Value: Determine the maximum value between two numbers.
Round Off: Round off a number to the nearest integer.
How to Use
Compile the Code: Use a C++ compiler to compile the code.

bash
Copy code
g++ -o math_operations math_operations.cpp
Run the Program: Execute the compiled file.

bash
Copy code
./math_operations
Choose an Operation: The program will display a menu with different mathematical operations. Enter the number corresponding to the operation you want to perform.

Input Values: Provide the required input values when prompted.

View Results: The program will display the result of the operation.

Repeat or Exit: You can choose to restart the process or exit the program.
